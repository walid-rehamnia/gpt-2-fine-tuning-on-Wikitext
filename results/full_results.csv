15," Du Fu ( Wade – Giles : Tu Fu ; Chinese : 杜甫 ; 712 – 770 ) was a prominent Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty . Along with Li Bai ( Li Po ) , he is frequently called the greatest of the Chinese poets . His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations . His life , like the whole country , was devastated by the An Lushan Rebellion of 755 , and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest . 
",", however , was to write poetry in a style similar to that of Shaolin . He was born in Shaanxi Province in the 12th century , and studied at the Beijing University of Poetry . During his early life , his father taught him to read and write in Chinese . After his mother died in 1258 , the family moved to Shanghai , where he was educated by his uncle .","['was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations .

16," Although initially he was little @-@ known to other writers , his works came to be hugely influential in both Chinese and Japanese literary culture . Of his poetic writing , nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages . He has been called the "" Poet @-@ Historian "" and the "" Poet @-@ Sage "" by Chinese critics , while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as "" the Chinese Virgil , Horace , Ovid , Shakespeare , Milton , Burns , Wordsworth , Béranger , Hugo or Baudelaire "" . 
","of the Song "" , the title of one of his most famous works , and the author of a number of works of poetry and fiction .

18," Traditional Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work , a practice which Burton Watson attributes to "" the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality "" . Since many of Du Fu 's poems feature morality and history , this practice is particularly important . Another reason , identified by the Chinese historian William Hung , is that Chinese poems are typically concise , omitting context that might be relevant , but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know . For modern Western readers , "" The less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether "" . Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu , arguing that the variety of the poet 's work required consideration of his whole life , rather than the "" reductive "" categorizations used for more limited poets . 
","This is especially important in the case of Song , who is often described as a character in a poem , rather than as an individual . In contrast , Song is generally characterized by a series of short stories , each of which deals with a different subject . The stories are often written in Chinese , and the reader is encouraged to read the stories in order to understand what they are about . Although the story itself is not a novel , it is important to note that it does not contain a single line or line of poetry . Instead , the poem is a collection of anecdotes and anecdotes from the past , present and future , which can be used to construct a better understanding of what happened during the Song era .","['For modern Western readers , "" The less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether "" .

23," In the early 730s , he travelled in the Jiangsu / Zhejiang area ; his earliest surviving poem , describing a poetry contest , is thought to date from the end of this period , around 735 . In that year , he took the civil service exam , likely in Chang 'an . He failed , to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics .

25," In the autumn of 744 , he met Li Bai ( Li Po ) for the first time , and the two poets formed a friendship . David Young describes this as "" the most significant formative element in Du Fu 's artistic development "" because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet @-@ scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam . The relationship was somewhat one @-@ sided , however . Du Fu was by some years the younger , while Li Bai was already a poetic star .

52," Du Fu 's work is notable above all for its range . Chinese critics traditionally used the term 集大成 ( jídàchéng- "" complete symphony "" ) , a reference to Mencius ' description of Confucius . Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu 's achievement , writing in 813 that his predecessor , "" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly "" . He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he "" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples "" . Furthermore , his poems use a wide range of registers , from the direct and colloquial to the allusive and self @-@ consciously literary . This variety is manifested even within individual works : Owen identifies the , "" rapid stylistic and thematic shifts "" in poems which enable the poet to represent different facets of a situation , while Chou uses the term "" juxtaposition "" as the major analytical tool in her work . Du Fu is noted for having written more on poetics and painting than any other writer of his time . He wrote eighteen poems on painting alone , more than any other Tang poet .

58," In his lifetime and immediately following his death , Du Fu was not greatly appreciated . In part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations , some of which are still "" considered extremely daring and bizarre by Chinese critics .

59," However , as Hung notes , he "" is the only Chinese poet whose influence grew with time "" , and his works began to increase in popularity in the ninth century . Early positive comments came from Bai Juyi , who praised the moral sentiments of some of Du Fu 's works ( although he found these in only a small fraction of the poems ) , and from Han Yu , who wrote a piece defending Du Fu and Li Bai on aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them .

60," It was in the 11th century , during the Northern Song era that Du Fu 's reputation reached its peak . In this period a comprehensive re @-@ evaluation of earlier poets took place , in which Wang Wei , Li Bai and Du Fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the Buddhist , Daoist and Confucian strands of Chinese culture . At the same time , the development of Neo @-@ Confucianism ensured that Du Fu , as its poetic exemplar , occupied the paramount position . Su Shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that Du Fu was "" preeminent ... because ... through all his vicissitudes , he never for the space of a meal forgot his sovereign "" . His influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites : political conservatives were attracted by his loyalty to the established order , while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor . Literary conservatives could look to his technical mastery , while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations . Since the establishment of the People 's Republic of China , Du Fu 's loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embryonic nationalism and socialism , and he has been praised for his use of simple , "" people 's language "" .

According to the Oxford Dictionary of Poetry , "" Poet "" is defined as "" a person who has attained the rank of a poet or a scholar , and who , having attained this rank , has been regarded by many as the greatest poet ever to have written . The term "" scholar "" has also been used to refer to those who have not yet reached the peak of their literary merit . This distinction was made even more difficult by the fact that many of the early Chinese writers were not fully fluent in Chinese . For example , Liu Xiaolong , who was the first to write in a language other than Chinese , was not fluent at the time of his death .","['never for the space of a meal forgot his sovereign "" .

61," Du Fu 's popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of Shakespeare in England : it was hard for any Chinese poet not to be influenced by him . While there was never another Du Fu , individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work : Bai Juyi 's concern for the poor , Lu You 's patriotism , and Mei Yaochen 's reflections on the quotidian are a few examples . More broadly , Du Fu 's work in transforming the lǜshi from mere word play into "" a vehicle for serious poetic utterance "" set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre . 
","for example , the poet Huizong was known to have been influenced in a number of ways by Du Fuego , and the author of the famous poem "" The Song of Zhou "" was also known for his contribution to Chinese literature .

The first notable Japanese appreciator of Du Fu 's poetry was Kokan Shiren ( 1278 – 1346 ) , a Rinzai Zen patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the Five Mountains ; he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on some poems of Du Fu from the perspective of a Zen priest in Vol . 11 of Saihokushū . His student Chūgan Engetsu composed many kanshi which were clearly stated "" influenced by Du Fu "" in their prefaces . Chūgan 's student Gidō Shūshin had close connection with the Court and Ashikaga Shogunate and propagated Du Fu 's poetry in the mundane world ; one day Nijō Yoshimoto , the Kampaku regent of the Court and the highest authority of renga poetry , asked Gidō , "" Should I learn the poetry of Du Fu and Li Bai ?

68," A variety of styles have been used in efforts to translate Du Fu 's work into English . As Burton Watson remarks in The Selected Poems of Du Fu , "" There are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating Du Fu , which is why we need as many different translations as possible "" ( p. xxii ) . The translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding laboured to a Western ear ( particularly when translating regulated verse , or lǜshi ) , and accommodating the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works ( Hawkes writes that "" his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation "" — p. ix ) . One extreme on each issue is represented by Kenneth Rexroth 's One Hundred Poems From the Chinese . His are free translations , which seek to conceal the parallelisms through enjambement and expansion and contraction of the content ; his responses to the allusions are firstly to omit most of these poems from his selection , and secondly to "" translate out "" the references in those works which he does select .

This approach has resulted in a wide range of translations , most of which appear to have fallen short of what is required to fully translate the work .

111," Despite the expensive reconstructions , both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War , and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war . Following the loss of most of the IJN 's large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid @-@ 1942 , they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of floatplanes . A lack of aircraft and qualified pilots , however , meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat . While awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases . They participated in the Battle of Cape Engaño in late 1944 , where they decoyed the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches . Afterwards both ships were transferred to Southeast Asia ; in early 1945 they participated in Operation Kita , where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan . The sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during American airstrikes in July . After the war they were scrapped in 1946 – 47 .

In late 1945 , as part of a salvage effort to recover the sunken battleship , a replacement ship was salvaged from the wreck of HMS Victory , which had been sunk by a Japanese submarine during World War II . This salvage attempt was unsuccessful , but the ship survived and was restored to service in early 1946 . After the sinking of Victory in June 1946 , it was transferred to Royal Australian Navy salvage yards , where it remained until the end of 1947 .","['air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases .

114," In the aftermath , the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean : Britain and the United States . Satō Tetsutarō , a Japanese Navy admiral and military theorist , speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals . To that end , he called for the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70 % as many capital ships as the US Navy . This ratio , Satō theorized , would enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict . Accordingly , the 1907 Imperial Defence Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships , 20 @,@ 000 long tons ( 20 @,@ 321 t ) each , and eight modern armoured cruisers , 18 @,@ 000 long tons ( 18 @,@ 289 t ) each .

In response , Prime Minister Harold Macmillan ordered the surrender of all Japanese ships , ships and aircraft , and declared war on Japan on September 11 , 2001 .

116," The first battleships built for the renewed Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program were the two dreadnoughts of the Kawachi class , ordered in 1907 and laid down in 1908 . In 1910 , the Navy put forward a request to the Diet ( parliament ) to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once . Because of economic constraints , only four battlecruisers and a single battleship of the Fusō class were ultimately approved by the Diet . Three more Fusō @-@ class ships ( Yamashiro , Ise , and Hyūga ) were approved and all three were ordered in April 1913 .

118," The progress of Fusō 's construction , while the IJN waited for the funding to be released and foreign developments , caused the IJN to reassess the Fusō @-@ class design . The distribution of the midships gun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the protection of the midships magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired . Another issue was that Japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the 45 @.@ 36 @-@ kilogram ( 100 @.@ 0 lb ) shells used in the manually loaded 152 @-@ millimetre ( 6 in ) secondary guns used in the Fusō class and earlier designs . To resolve this issue , the IJN designed a smaller 140 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire . It also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the British Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships and Russian Borodino @-@ class battlecruisers . For financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by 0 @.@ 5 knots ( 0 @.@ 93 km / h ; 0 @.@ 58 mph ) to 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . To save weight the forecastle deck was shortened so that the lower midships gun turret was lower than in the Fusō class .

To further protect the magazines the depth of the double bottom was increased to a total of 3 @.@ 58 metres ( 11 ft 9 in ) underneath the barbettes and magazines .

However , due to the lack of ammunition for the ammunition magazines , it was impossible to fire a single magazine at once .

Earlier proposals to convert one or more battleships into carriers had been made and rejected at the beginning of the war , but they were revived after Midway .

207," From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North , the North Korean People 's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing . The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively , attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit , which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force , which would then be forced to retreat in disarray , often leaving behind much of its equipment . From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August , the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south . However , when the UN forces , under the Eighth United States Army , established the Pusan Perimeter in August , the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank , and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army . 
","then move on to the rear . This strategy had worked well for the South Korean forces , who were able to hold their ground until the last possible moment . However , in the event of a successful counter @-@ attack , they would have been forced to retreat to their bunkers , where they could be attacked again and again . On the other hand , if the U.S. and South Koreans were to be defeated , it would be necessary for them to withdraw from their bases in order to avoid further casualties . In this situation , both sides were faced with a choice : either surrender or face the consequences of their actions . If surrender was the only option , then the war would end in a stalemate , with the two sides remaining in their respective bases for a period of time .","['then be forced to retreat in disarray , often leaving behind much of its equipment .

208," When the North Koreans approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5 , they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter . Throughout August , the NK 6th Division , and later the NK 7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan , initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before countering with battles at Komam @-@ ni and Battle Mountain .

North of Masan , the NK 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area .

"" Failing in frontal infantry attack to reduce the little defending force , the North Koreans now meant to take it under mortar fire . Only 45 minutes later North Korean antitank fire came in on the knob and two machine guns from positions northward and higher on the slope of Hill 209 swept the perimeter . Soon , mortars emplaced on a neighboring high finger ridge eastward registered on Schmitt 's perimeter and continued firing until dark . The machine gun fire forced every man to stay in his foxhole . The lifting of the mortar fire after dark was the signal for renewed North Korean infantry attacks , all of which were repulsed . But the number of killed and wounded within the perimeter was growing , and supplies were diminishing . There were no medical supplies except those carried by one aid man .

Since the previous afternoon , North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter . Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed . Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself . Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole . Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units . Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came . Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and threw grenades into it . Six times Ouellette leaped from his foxhole to escape grenades thrown into it . In this close action Ouellette was killed . Most of the foxholes of the perimeter received one or more direct mortar hits in the course of the continuing mortar fire . One of these killed Schmitt on September 3 .

This was the first time that the US had ever fired a single shell at a base since the end of World War II , and it marked the beginning of a new phase of fighting in the Korean peninsula . In addition to the heavy artillery fire , there was also heavy mortar fire that lasted for several hours .

When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines . That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position . At 22 : 00 , McDoniel and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four . Master Sergeant Travis E.

346," An ironclad is a steam @-@ propelled warship protected by iron or steel armor plates used in the early part of the second half of the 19th century . The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells . The first ironclad battleship , Gloire , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859 . The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857 ; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron @-@ hulled armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all @-@ armored battle fleet . After the first clashes of ironclads ( both with wooden ships and with one another ) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War , it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat . This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War . 
","design was submitted to the Royal Navy for approval . However , it was rejected due to concerns that the ship would be too heavy to be carried by a ship of its class . In 1864 , the British commissioned the first Ironclad Battlecruiser , which was built to replace the flagship HMS Queen Elizabeth . It was commissioned in May 1865 , and was decommissioned at the end of that year . During the Second World War , she was heavily damaged during the Battle of Britain , resulting in her being scrapped . She was later restored to service as the Queen 's flagship .","['Royal Navy started building two iron @-@ hulled armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all @-@ armored battle fleet .

347," Ironclads were designed for several roles , including as high seas battleships , coastal defense ships , and long @-@ range cruisers .

348," The quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished , and that naval tactics were in a state of flux . Many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo , which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat .

350," The ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the 19th century . According to naval historian J.

It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad . "" Each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads .

"" Hill further noted that the ship had a "" thick steel hull "" , which made it easier to manoeuvre than the other two boats . In addition , the iron clad ship was equipped with a torpedo tube which could be fired from the torpedo port .","['and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells .

352," In the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship , the ship of the line and the frigate . The first major change to these types was the introduction of steam power for propulsion . While paddle steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards , steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s . 
","of a new class of battleships in the late 16th century . These ships were powered by steam @-@ powered boilers , which allowed them to operate at a much higher rate of power than their steam powered counterparts .","['of steam power for propulsion .

353," Steam @-@ powered screw frigates were built in the mid @-@ 1840s , and at the end of the decade the French Navy introduced steam power to its line of battle . The desire for change came from the ambition of Napoleon III to gain greater influence in Europe , which required a challenge to the British at sea . The first purpose @-@ built steam battleship was the 90 @-@ gun Napoléon in 1850 . Napoléon was armed as a conventional ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line , but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) , regardless of the wind conditions : a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement . 
","steam powered battleships were launched in France in 1848 , but by 1849 the fleet had been reduced to four ships . By 1851 , only two ships were in service , with the rest being scrapped in favour of two new ships , one of which was commissioned in 1860 and the other in 1865 . In the late 19th century , the Royal Navy began construction of a new fleet of four destroyers and two cruisers .","['purpose @-@ built steam battleship was the 90 @-@ gun Napoléon in 1850 .

354," The introduction of the steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line led to a building competition between France and Britain . Eight sister ships to Napoléon were built in France over a period of ten years , but the United Kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production .

","first of these was commissioned in 1833 . The first ship to enter the competition was the Royal Navy 's flagship , the HMS Queen Elizabeth , which entered service in May 1834 .

356," The era of the wooden steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line was brief , because of new , more powerful naval guns .

Then , the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French Général Henri @-@ Joseph Paixhans , and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the French Navy , Royal Navy , Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy . It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls , as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of Sinop , spelled the end of the wooden @-@ hulled warship .

359," Following the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the Battle of Sinop , and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the Paixhans guns of Russian fortifications in the Crimean War , Emperor Napoleon III ordered the development of light @-@ draft floating batteries , equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor .

360," The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War . The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications . The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave , Tonnante and Dévastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea , where they were effective against Russian shore defences .

365," The Royal Navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage in steam ships of the line , but was determined that the first British ironclad would outmatch the French ships in every respect , particularly speed .

The use of iron in the construction of Warrior also came with some drawbacks ; iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls , and iron was more susceptible to fouling by marine life . 
","the latter proved more difficult to construct than the former , and they were scrapped in the late 19th century . HMS White Rose was built in 1859 , with a total of six ships . It was commissioned in 1865 , the last of which was a destroyer . In 1871 , it was decommissioned and replaced by HMS Blue Rose , a cruiser built for the British Commonwealth War Graves Commission .

393," The weakness of the breech @-@ loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech . All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of gunpowder into gas . This explosion propels the shot or shell out of the front of the gun , but also imposes great stresses on the gun @-@ barrel . If the breech — which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun — is not entirely secure , then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break . This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew . The Warrior 's Armstrong guns suffered from both problems ; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4 @.@ 5 in ( 118 mm ) armor of Gloire , while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing .

396," From 1875 onwards , the balance between breech- and muzzle @-@ loading changed . Captain de Bange invented a method of reliably sealing a breech , adopted by the French in 1873 . Just as compellingly , the growing size of naval guns made muzzle @-@ loading much more complicated . With guns of such size there was no prospect of hauling in the gun for re @-@ loading , or even re @-@ loading by hand , and complicated hydraulic systems were required for re @-@ loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire .

398," The calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far . The larger the gun , the slower it would be to load , the greater the stresses on the ship 's hull , and the less the stability of the ship . The size of the gun peaked in the 1880s , with some of the heaviest calibres of gun ever used at sea . HMS Benbow carried two 16 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 413 mm ) breech @-@ loading guns , each weighing 110 tons — no British battleship would ever carry guns as large . The Italian 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 72 inch ) guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the 18 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 460 mm ) armament of the Japanese Yamato class of World War II . One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models , following the Crimean War , range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy , especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as ' floating weapons @-@ platform ' could negate the advantage of rifling . American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least ' skip ' along the surface of the water . Actual effective combat ranges , they had learned during the Civil War , were comparable to those in the Age of Sail — though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds . Smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem . As a result , many naval engagements in the ' Age of the Ironclad ' were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets , and well below the maximum reach of their ships ' guns . 
","Japanese design the guns were too heavy to be of practical use . This was due to the lack of ammunition and ammunition magazines , which could not be loaded . In the late 19th century , a new design was introduced which allowed for the firing of two guns at once , one at a time , without the need for magazines or ammunition . However , this was not the case at the time and was replaced by a single gun at each firing position . A second gun could be fired at any time during the day and at night , while the first gun was still firing . It was also possible to fire both guns simultaneously without magazines and magazines . As a result , it was impossible for a battlecruiser to operate at full load without a magazine or magazine , making it difficult to manoeuvre the ships around the battleships . Consequently , there was no way to store ammunition , ammunition or spare parts in a gun without having to carry them around .  The guns had a maximum range of 12 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 20 @ 000 km ) and were capable of firing up to 300 rounds per minute . They were powered by two 120 mm guns mounted in turrets on each side of each hull . These turrets were mounted on top of one another , giving them a beam of 120 feet ( 36 m ) . Each turret was equipped with a firing pin and a rangefinder , both of which were designed to measure the distance between the two turrets . There were","[""Armstrong models , following the Crimean War , range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy , especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as ' floating weapons @-@ platform ' could negate the advantage of rifling . American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least ' skip ' along the surface of the water . Actual effective combat ranges , they had learned during the Civil War , were comparable to those in the Age of Sail — though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds . Smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem . As a result , many naval engagements in the ' Age of the Ironclad ' were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets , and well below the maximum reach of their ships ' guns .""]"
399," Another method of increasing firepower was to vary the projectile fired or the nature of the propellant . Early ironclads used black powder , which expanded rapidly after combustion ; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels , to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell . The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress . One important step was to press the powder into pellets , allowing a slower , more controlled explosion and a longer barrel . A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again . It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel , allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances . 
","example of this was the firing of a cannon at a range of 100 yards ( 120 m ) from the target . This was because the muzzle velocity was so high that the shells could not be fired at the same time . Another example was firing a gun at an angle of 45 degrees to the right , thereby reducing the effective range by a factor of 10 .

408," There were two main design alternatives to the broadside . In one design , the guns were placed in an armoured casemate amidships : this arrangement was called the ' box @-@ battery ' or ' centre @-@ battery ' . In the other , the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire ; when fully armored , this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored , a barbette . 
","The casemates were designed to be mounted on either side of the main gun turret , with the centre of gravity at the front and the rear facing each other . This arrangement allowed the gun turrets to move in a straight line across the field of view , rather than facing forward .","['In the other , the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire ; when fully armored , this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored , a barbette .']"
409," The centre @-@ battery was the simpler and , during the 1860s and 1870s , the more popular method .

410," The turret was first used in naval combat on the USS Monitor in 1862 , with a type of turret designed by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson . A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor Cowper Coles with a prototype of this installed on HMS Trusty in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes . Ericsson 's turret turned on a central spindle , and Coles 's turned on a ring of bearings . Turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns , but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s . The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging , so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean @-@ going ironclads . The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy . Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret ( guns and armour protection ) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard . The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour . Low freeboard , however , also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage — and therefore range of the vessel . In many respects , the turreted , low @-@ freeboard Monitor and the broadside sailer HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an ' Ironclad ' was all about . The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes , or ' squaring this circle ' , was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles : HMS Captain , a dangerously low freeboard turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail , and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870 . Her half @-@ sister HMS Monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams . The third Royal Navy ship to combine turrets and masts was HMS Inflexible of 1876 , which carried two turrets on either side of the centre @-@ line , allowing both to fire fore , aft and broadside . 
","to the lower deck of the ship , where it could be used to store ammunition and spare parts . This allowed the turret to be lowered to a maximum of 15 feet ( 2 @.@ 8 m ) above sea level , which allowed it to withstand the high winds and rough seas . In the late 19th century , it was also used as a gunnery platform for the Royal Australian Navy . It was later converted into a torpedo boat and later became the flagship of HMS Queen Elizabeth , the first ship ever to have one of these turrets installed . By the end of World War I , only two turrets had been installed , one in England and the other in Wales . However , both turrets remained in service until 1918 , when the conversion was completed .

413," The ironclad age saw the development of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons , which helped complicate the design and tactics of ironclad fleets . The first torpedoes were static mines , used extensively in the American Civil War . That conflict also saw the development of the spar torpedo , an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat . For the first time , a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one — and given the relative inefficiency of shellfire against ironclads , the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously . The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become turretless armored spar @-@ torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864 – 5 , but these vessels never saw action .

Warrior also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion ; she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail ( though in practice the steam engine was run at a low throttle ) , and a telescopic funnel which could be folded down to the deck level .

The ship was powered by two steam turbines , one at the stern and one on the deck . This allowed the ship to operate at a cruising speed of 60 knots ( 120 km / h ) , making it the fastest ship ever built .","['the early ironclads .

433," Ships designed for coastal warfare , like the floating batteries of the Crimea , or USS Monitor and her sisters , dispensed with masts from the beginning . The British HMS Devastation , started in 1869 , was the first large , ocean @-@ going ironclad to dispense with masts . Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters ; and while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic , she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean . The Devastation and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule . Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts , and only the Italian navy , which during that decade was focused on short @-@ range operations in the Adriatic , built consistently mastless ironclads . 
","support a large fleet of ships , she was not the only ship in her class to do so . She was also the last ship to be commissioned into the Royal Navy , and the ship 's name was changed to the British Admiralty . In 1871 , the flagship of HMS Enterprise was decommissioned and replaced by a new flagship , HMS Defiant , which served as a flagship for the fleet until the end of World War I , when it was scrapped .","['cross the Atlantic , she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean .

434," During the 1860s , steam engines improved with the adoption of double @-@ expansion steam engines , which used 30 – 40 % less coal than earlier models . The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double @-@ expansion engine in 1871 , and by 1875 they were widespread . However , this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast . Whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails , or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation , is a matter of debate . A steam @-@ only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide , which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands . Just as significantly , because of unsolved problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines , the performance of double @-@ expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory . 
","to an increasing demand for steam powered ships , is unclear . In the late 19th century , it was common for ships to be powered by double expansion engines rather than double expanded engines . This changed in the 1970s and 1980s as the steam industry began to diversify into new sources of steam power , such as steam turbines and steam turbine power plants . As a result of this diversification , ships were able to operate at a much lower rate of fuel consumption than they did at the start of their careers , leading to higher fuel prices and lower fuel efficiency .","['to the operational and strategic situation , is a matter of debate .
