15," Du Fu ( Wade – Giles : Tu Fu ; Chinese : 杜甫 ; 712 – 770 ) was a prominent Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty . Along with Li Bai ( Li Po ) , he is frequently called the greatest of the Chinese poets . His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations . His life , like the whole country , was devastated by the An Lushan Rebellion of 755 , and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest . 
",", however , was to write a poem that could be translated into English . The poem was written in the early seventeenth century , but it was not published until the late eighteenth century . It is believed to have been written by Li Fu , who was the first to translate the poem into Chinese . He was also the author of a number of works of poetry , most of which are known to be of Chinese origin .","['was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations .

16," Although initially he was little @-@ known to other writers , his works came to be hugely influential in both Chinese and Japanese literary culture . Of his poetic writing , nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages . He has been called the "" Poet @-@ Historian "" and the "" Poet @-@ Sage "" by Chinese critics , while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as "" the Chinese Virgil , Horace , Ovid , Shakespeare , Milton , Burns , Wordsworth , Béranger , Hugo or Baudelaire "" .

18," Traditional Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work , a practice which Burton Watson attributes to "" the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality "" . Since many of Du Fu 's poems feature morality and history , this practice is particularly important . Another reason , identified by the Chinese historian William Hung , is that Chinese poems are typically concise , omitting context that might be relevant , but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know . For modern Western readers , "" The less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether "" . Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu , arguing that the variety of the poet 's work required consideration of his whole life , rather than the "" reductive "" categorizations used for more limited poets . 
","This is especially important in the case of poetry , where the reader is expected to be familiar with the meaning of a poem , and to understand its meaning in a way that is consistent with its context . In the same vein , Burton writes , "" Poetry is a form of self-reflection . It is an expression of one's own self . "" In other words , the poem is not merely a reflection of oneself but of others . Burton describes the poet as "" a person who is able to see the world through the eyes of his or her own eyes . He or she is aware of what is going on around him or herself . .","['For modern Western readers , "" The less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether "" .

Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown , except that it was near Luoyang , Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ) . In later life , he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an , ancestral hometown of the Du family .

23," In the early 730s , he travelled in the Jiangsu / Zhejiang area ; his earliest surviving poem , describing a poetry contest , is thought to date from the end of this period , around 735 . In that year , he took the civil service exam , likely in Chang 'an . He failed , to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics . Hung concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure , while Chou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame . After this failure , he went back to traveling , this time around Shandong and Hebei .

25," In the autumn of 744 , he met Li Bai ( Li Po ) for the first time , and the two poets formed a friendship . David Young describes this as "" the most significant formative element in Du Fu 's artistic development "" because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet @-@ scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam . The relationship was somewhat one @-@ sided , however . Du Fu was by some years the younger , while Li Bai was already a poetic star .

He never again attempted the examinations , instead petitioning the emperor directly in 751 , 754 and probably again in 755 . He married around 752 , and by 757 the couple had had five children — three sons and two daughters — but one of the sons died in infancy in 755 . From 754 he began to have lung problems ( probably asthma ) , the first of a series of ailments which dogged him for the rest of his life .

During this time , Du Fu led a largely itinerant life unsettled by wars , associated famines and imperial displeasure . This period of unhappiness was the making of Du Fu as a poet : Even Shan Chou has written that , "" What he saw around him — the lives of his family , neighbors , and strangers – what he heard , and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns — these became the enduring themes of his poetry "" .

He was arrested but was pardoned in June . He was granted leave to visit his family in September , but he soon rejoined the court and on December 8 , 757 , he returned to Chang 'an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces .

52," Du Fu 's work is notable above all for its range . Chinese critics traditionally used the term 集大成 ( jídàchéng- "" complete symphony "" ) , a reference to Mencius ' description of Confucius . Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu 's achievement , writing in 813 that his predecessor , "" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly "" . He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he "" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples "" . Furthermore , his poems use a wide range of registers , from the direct and colloquial to the allusive and self @-@ consciously literary . This variety is manifested even within individual works : Owen identifies the , "" rapid stylistic and thematic shifts "" in poems which enable the poet to represent different facets of a situation , while Chou uses the term "" juxtaposition "" as the major analytical tool in her work . Du Fu is noted for having written more on poetics and painting than any other writer of his time . He wrote eighteen poems on painting alone , more than any other Tang poet .

The poem is one of the most popular poems in Chinese history , and it has been translated into English as the Song of Song , which is considered by many to be the greatest poem of all time , as well as being the only poem written by a Chinese poet to have been published in English before the Ming Dynasty .

60," It was in the 11th century , during the Northern Song era that Du Fu 's reputation reached its peak . In this period a comprehensive re @-@ evaluation of earlier poets took place , in which Wang Wei , Li Bai and Du Fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the Buddhist , Daoist and Confucian strands of Chinese culture . At the same time , the development of Neo @-@ Confucianism ensured that Du Fu , as its poetic exemplar , occupied the paramount position . Su Shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that Du Fu was "" preeminent ... because ... through all his vicissitudes , he never for the space of a meal forgot his sovereign "" . His influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites : political conservatives were attracted by his loyalty to the established order , while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor . Literary conservatives could look to his technical mastery , while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations .

61," Du Fu 's popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of Shakespeare in England : it was hard for any Chinese poet not to be influenced by him . While there was never another Du Fu , individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work : Bai Juyi 's concern for the poor , Lu You 's patriotism , and Mei Yaochen 's reflections on the quotidian are a few examples . More broadly , Du Fu 's work in transforming the lǜshi from mere word play into "" a vehicle for serious poetic utterance "" set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre . 
","for example , he was the first poet to write a poem in which the subject of the poem was not mentioned ; and he is the only poet who has written a single poem that has not been translated into English .

The first notable Japanese appreciator of Du Fu 's poetry was Kokan Shiren ( 1278 – 1346 ) , a Rinzai Zen patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the Five Mountains ; he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on some poems of Du Fu from the perspective of a Zen priest in Vol . 11 of Saihokushū . His student Chūgan Engetsu composed many kanshi which were clearly stated "" influenced by Du Fu "" in their prefaces . Chūgan 's student Gidō Shūshin had close connection with the Court and Ashikaga Shogunate and propagated Du Fu 's poetry in the mundane world ; one day Nijō Yoshimoto , the Kampaku regent of the Court and the highest authority of renga poetry , asked Gidō , "" Should I learn the poetry of Du Fu and Li Bai ?

The commentary established Du Fu 's fame as the highest of all poets ; for instance , Hayashi Shunsai , a notable Confucian scholar , commented in Vol . 37 of Gahō Bunshū that Zǐměi [ Du Fu ] was the very best poet in history and praised Shào Chuán 's commentary for its simplicity and readability , while he criticized old commentaries during the Yuan Dynasty were too unfathomable .

As Burton Watson remarks in The Selected Poems of Du Fu , "" There are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating Du Fu , which is why we need as many different translations as possible "" ( p. xxii ) . The translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding laboured to a Western ear ( particularly when translating regulated verse , or lǜshi ) , and accommodating the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works ( Hawkes writes that "" his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation "" — p. ix ) . One extreme on each issue is represented by Kenneth Rexroth 's One Hundred Poems From the Chinese . His are free translations , which seek to conceal the parallelisms through enjambement and expansion and contraction of the content ; his responses to the allusions are firstly to omit most of these poems from his selection , and secondly to "" translate out "" the references in those works which he does select . 
","within a single verse . In this case , the translation is done in a way that allows the reader to understand the meaning of a verse without being overwhelmed by the complexity of its meaning .

The most common way to do this is to use a combination of English and French , with the emphasis placed on punctuation and grammatical structure in order to make the work easier to read and understood by those who are familiar with French and English  , as well as those unfamiliar with Chinese and other dialects of Chinese .

111," Despite the expensive reconstructions , both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War , and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war . Following the loss of most of the IJN 's large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid @-@ 1942 , they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of floatplanes . A lack of aircraft and qualified pilots , however , meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat . While awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases . They participated in the Battle of Cape Engaño in late 1944 , where they decoyed the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches . Afterwards both ships were transferred to Southeast Asia ; in early 1945 they participated in Operation Kita , where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan . The sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during American airstrikes in July . After the war they were scrapped in 1946 – 47 .

The F-22 Raptor was the first of these to be built , but it was not until the end of World War II that the aircraft became a major part of American naval aviation .  The aircraft were used extensively in World Wars I , II and III , as well as the Korean War and the Vietnam War . In addition to its role as a carrier , it also served as an anti-aircraft gunner and was used in a variety of combat roles , such as in support of Japanese forces during Operation Enduring Freedom , Operation Desert Storm and Operation Barbarossa . It was also used for reconnaissance missions against enemy forces in Europe , Africa , Asia , South America , Australia , New Zealand and other parts of Asia .

113," The design of the Fusō @-@ class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an encounter in Japanese territorial waters .

114," In the aftermath , the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean : Britain and the United States . Satō Tetsutarō , a Japanese Navy admiral and military theorist , speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals . To that end , he called for the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70 % as many capital ships as the US Navy . This ratio , Satō theorized , would enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict . Accordingly , the 1907 Imperial Defence Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships , 20 @,@ 000 long tons ( 20 @,@ 321 t ) each , and eight modern armoured cruisers , 18 @,@ 000 long tons ( 18 @,@ 289 t ) each .

In the event , Japan would be forced to rely more heavily on its navy to defend its territorial waters , which it would then be able to exploit to its own advantage . As a result , Japanese naval power would become less dependent on the American navy and more dependent upon the British navy . The United Kingdom , for its part , was more interested in maintaining its naval superiority over Japan , and was willing to invest heavily in defense of the islands . Japan was also more likely to use its military might to protect its territory from attack , as evidenced by the fact that it was the first country to establish a naval base on a major island .

116," The first battleships built for the renewed Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program were the two dreadnoughts of the Kawachi class , ordered in 1907 and laid down in 1908 . In 1910 , the Navy put forward a request to the Diet ( parliament ) to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once . Because of economic constraints , only four battlecruisers and a single battleship of the Fusō class were ultimately approved by the Diet . Three more Fusō @-@ class ships ( Yamashiro , Ise , and Hyūga ) were approved and all three were ordered in April 1913 .

118," The progress of Fusō 's construction , while the IJN waited for the funding to be released and foreign developments , caused the IJN to reassess the Fusō @-@ class design . The distribution of the midships gun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the protection of the midships magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired . Another issue was that Japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the 45 @.@ 36 @-@ kilogram ( 100 @.@ 0 lb ) shells used in the manually loaded 152 @-@ millimetre ( 6 in ) secondary guns used in the Fusō class and earlier designs . To resolve this issue , the IJN designed a smaller 140 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire . It also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the British Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships and Russian Borodino @-@ class battlecruisers . For financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by 0 @.@ 5 knots ( 0 @.@ 93 km / h ; 0 @.@ 58 mph ) to 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . To save weight the forecastle deck was shortened so that the lower midships gun turret was lower than in the Fusō class . This reduced the crew 's accommodations despite a significant increase in the crew 's numbers and naval historian Fukui Shizuo believed that these ships had the worst habitability of any Japanese capital ship . The final design was designated A @-@ 92 by the IJN and differed enough from the A @-@ 64 design of the Fusō class that it was considered a separate class . 
","in armour thickness to compensate for this . This was achieved by increasing the thickness of each shell by a factor of 10 , and by reducing the number of shells per shell . In addition , it decided to reduce the amount of armour that could be removed from the hull by the addition of a new shell casing , which would allow the shell to pass through the armour more easily . Finally , as a result of this decision , all the new shells were fitted with an anti-ballistic missile system that was capable of firing at a range of 1,000 m ( 2,500 ft ) . 
  The design was completed in 1945 , but was not completed until the end of World War II , during which time it was used extensively in submarine warfare , in which it served as the main weapon of choice for both the U.S. Navy and the Japanese armed forces as well as as in naval operations in Europe and North Africa , including the invasion of Sicily and Sicily ' s Italian island of Sardinia , where it had been used for more than a decade .","[""in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the British Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships and Russian Borodino @-@ class battlecruisers .

207," From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North , the North Korean People 's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing . The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively , attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit , which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force , which would then be forced to retreat in disarray , often leaving behind much of its equipment . From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August , the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south . However , when the UN forces , under the Eighth United States Army , established the Pusan Perimeter in August , the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank , and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army .

In the end , however , both sides were forced to retreat to the south , where they were able to hold out for a few days until reinforcements could be sent to reinforce their forces . During the war , North Korea launched a series of air attacks on the U.S. mainland , including an attack on Pearl Harbor , a major naval base in the Pacific Ocean , and a surprise attack against the USS Cole , an amphibious assault ship that had been sunk by a Japanese submarine . On the morning of April 19 , 1945 , South Koreans were ordered to evacuate their homes to safety , but the evacuation was delayed for several days due to a shortage of food and medical supplies .

255," During the night Schmitt established radio communication with the 1st Battalion , 9th infantry . When daylight came Schmitt and his group saw that they were surrounded by North Koreans . One force occupied the higher knob half a mile above them , formerly held by B Company . Below them , North Koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units , some of them already several miles eastward . The North Koreans quickly discovered Task Force Manchu group . They first attacked it at 14 : 00 that afternoon , and were repulsed .

The enemy continued firing on them until they reached their base , which was under the command of General Kim Il-sung , the commander of North Korea 's armed forces .

"" Failing in frontal infantry attack to reduce the little defending force , the North Koreans now meant to take it under mortar fire . Only 45 minutes later North Korean antitank fire came in on the knob and two machine guns from positions northward and higher on the slope of Hill 209 swept the perimeter . Soon , mortars emplaced on a neighboring high finger ridge eastward registered on Schmitt 's perimeter and continued firing until dark . The machine gun fire forced every man to stay in his foxhole . The lifting of the mortar fire after dark was the signal for renewed North Korean infantry attacks , all of which were repulsed . But the number of killed and wounded within the perimeter was growing , and supplies were diminishing . There were no medical supplies except those carried by one aid man .

Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole . Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units . Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came . Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and threw grenades into it . Six times Ouellette leaped from his foxhole to escape grenades thrown into it . In this close action Ouellette was killed .

When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines . That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position . At 22 : 00 , McDoniel and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four . Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins , still alive in his paralyzed condition , refused efforts of evacuation , saying that he did not want to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away .

346," An ironclad is a steam @-@ propelled warship protected by iron or steel armor plates used in the early part of the second half of the 19th century . The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells . The first ironclad battleship , Gloire , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859 . The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857 ; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron @-@ hulled armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all @-@ armored battle fleet . After the first clashes of ironclads ( both with wooden ships and with one another ) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War , it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat . This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War . 
","design was submitted to the Royal Navy for design consideration . In 1864 , the British Navy commissioned a new design , which included a steel hull and a reinforced hull . This design had the advantage of being able to withstand a large number of explosive shells , but it was not designed to be used as an anti-aircraft gun . It was considered too heavy for use in naval warfare , and was therefore scrapped in favour of a lighter, more maneuverable design . During the Second World War , during the Battle of Britain , a British destroyer was sunk by a German submarine after being hit by an incendiary shell .","['Royal Navy started building two iron @-@ hulled armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all @-@ armored battle fleet .

347," Ironclads were designed for several roles , including as high seas battleships , coastal defense ships , and long @-@ range cruisers .

348," The quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished , and that naval tactics were in a state of flux . Many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo , which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat . There is no clear end to the ironclad period , but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use . New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers . 
","thought would be a better option than a single torpedo . In the end , however , it was decided that the best solution was to use a combination of two torpedoes , one of which would destroy the target and the other would allow the ship to continue sailing . The second torpedo was the most common type of torpedo used by the British navy , but it had the advantage of being able to penetrate the hull of an enemy ship .","['considered the important weapons of naval combat .

It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad .

352," In the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship , the ship of the line and the frigate .

By 1844 , however , the fleet had been reduced to a few hundred and fifty ships .

The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications . The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave , Tonnante and Dévastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea , where they were effective against Russian shore defences .

365," The Royal Navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage in steam ships of the line , but was determined that the first British ironclad would outmatch the French ships in every respect , particularly speed .

The British specification was more a large , powerful frigate than a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line . The requirement for speed meant a very long vessel , which had to be built from iron . The result was the construction of two Warrior @-@ class ironclads ; HMS Warrior and HMS Black Prince .

393," The weakness of the breech @-@ loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech . All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of gunpowder into gas . This explosion propels the shot or shell out of the front of the gun , but also imposes great stresses on the gun @-@ barrel . If the breech — which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun — is not entirely secure , then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break . This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew . The Warrior 's Armstrong guns suffered from both problems ; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4 @.@ 5 in ( 118 mm ) armor of Gloire , while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing . Similar problems were experienced with the breech @-@ loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies .

It is important to note , however , that the recoil of a projectile is proportional to the amount of pressure applied to it .

395," The decision to retain muzzle @-@ loaders until the 1880s has been criticised by historians .

396," From 1875 onwards , the balance between breech- and muzzle @-@ loading changed . Captain de Bange invented a method of reliably sealing a breech , adopted by the French in 1873 . Just as compellingly , the growing size of naval guns made muzzle @-@ loading much more complicated . With guns of such size there was no prospect of hauling in the gun for re @-@ loading , or even re @-@ loading by hand , and complicated hydraulic systems were required for re @-@ loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire .

397," In the Royal Navy , the switch to breech @-@ loaders was finally made in 1879 ; as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance , opinion was swayed by an explosion on board HMS Thunderer caused by a gun being double @-@ loaded , a problem which could only happen with a muzzle @-@ loading gun .

398," The calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far . The larger the gun , the slower it would be to load , the greater the stresses on the ship 's hull , and the less the stability of the ship . The size of the gun peaked in the 1880s , with some of the heaviest calibres of gun ever used at sea . HMS Benbow carried two 16 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 413 mm ) breech @-@ loading guns , each weighing 110 tons — no British battleship would ever carry guns as large . The Italian 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 72 inch ) guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the 18 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 460 mm ) armament of the Japanese Yamato class of World War II . One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models , following the Crimean War , range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy , especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as ' floating weapons @-@ platform ' could negate the advantage of rifling . American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least ' skip ' along the surface of the water . Actual effective combat ranges , they had learned during the Civil War , were comparable to those in the Age of Sail — though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds .

As a result , many naval engagements in the ' Age of the Ironclad ' were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets , and well below the maximum reach of their ships ' guns . 
","design the guns were too small to be used in combat . In the early 20th century , however , a new design was introduced to replace the old guns . This was the first time that a single gun could be mounted on a battlecruiser . It was also the only time in naval history that two guns had been used together in battle . As a result , battleships were often equipped with two or three guns at the same time , which allowed them to operate independently of each other . Battleships could also be fitted with three or four guns on each side of their hull to reduce the number of rounds required to fire a gun . These weapons were also used to increase the speed of a ship by reducing the amount of time it took to reload a weapon . A large part of this increased speed was due to the fact that each gun was loaded at a rate of 1,000 rounds per minute , making it easier for the crew to keep their guns in their hands . During the Battle of Leyte , for example , one gun fired a total of 4,500 rounds . By the time the battle was over , it was estimated that at least 2,800 rounds were needed to complete the task .","[""Armstrong models , following the Crimean War , range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy , especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as ' floating weapons @-@ platform ' could negate the advantage of rifling . American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least ' skip ' along the surface of the water . Actual effective combat ranges , they had learned during the Civil War , were comparable to those in the Age of Sail — though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds .

As a result , many naval engagements in the ' Age of the Ironclad ' were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets , and well below the maximum reach of their ships ' guns .""]"
399," Another method of increasing firepower was to vary the projectile fired or the nature of the propellant . Early ironclads used black powder , which expanded rapidly after combustion ; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels , to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell . The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress . One important step was to press the powder into pellets , allowing a slower , more controlled explosion and a longer barrel . A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again . It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel , allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances . 
","such method was the use of incendiary shells . In the early 19th century , the first incendiary shell was fired at a range of 1,000 yards ( 2,500 km ) . By the end of World War I , this method had been adopted by the United States and Britain , and was widely used in Europe and North America . However , in the late 1940s and early 1950s , it became increasingly common to fire incendiary projectiles at ranges of more than 100 yards or more .","['important step was to press the powder into pellets , allowing a slower , more controlled explosion and a longer barrel .

400," The development of smokeless powder , based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose , by the French inventor Paul Vielle in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels . The guns of the pre @-@ Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s , most often 12 in ( 305 mm ) , but progressively grew in length of barrel , making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity . 
","17th and 18th centuries were lighter and more powerful than those of modern warships , and were more likely to have been fired from the bow of a battleship rather than from a catapult .

405," A significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the 1860s , principally in Britain and France , but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy , Austria , Russia and the United States . The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time , and the rigging did not impede the field of fire . 
","States . By the end of the 19th century , however , iron clads had become increasingly common in Europe , particularly in Germany , France and Italy .

408," There were two main design alternatives to the broadside . In one design , the guns were placed in an armoured casemate amidships : this arrangement was called the ' box @-@ battery ' or ' centre @-@ battery ' . In the other , the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire ; when fully armored , this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored , a barbette . 
","The other design was to have two guns mounted on the sides of the casemates , one on each side , and the other on either side .

409," The centre @-@ battery was the simpler and , during the 1860s and 1870s , the more popular method .

410," The turret was first used in naval combat on the USS Monitor in 1862 , with a type of turret designed by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson . A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor Cowper Coles with a prototype of this installed on HMS Trusty in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes . Ericsson 's turret turned on a central spindle , and Coles 's turned on a ring of bearings . Turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns , but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s . The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging , so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean @-@ going ironclads . The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy . Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret ( guns and armour protection ) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard . The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour . Low freeboard , however , also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage — and therefore range of the vessel . In many respects , the turreted , low @-@ freeboard Monitor and the broadside sailer HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an ' Ironclad ' was all about . The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes , or ' squaring this circle ' , was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles : HMS Captain , a dangerously low freeboard turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail , and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870 . Her half @-@ sister HMS Monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams .

In the end , however , it was not possible to achieve the same level of accuracy as the first turret , because the hull was so heavy that it required a considerable amount of force to lift it off the deck . As a result , the second turret failed to meet the requirements of its predecessor . It was eventually replaced by a new design , which allowed it to operate at a much higher rate of speed and accuracy than the previous design . By the mid-1860s , this design had been adopted by several European navies , including the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Italy , Spain , Denmark , Norway , Sweden , Finland , Switzerland , Austria , Belgium , Holland , Luxembourg , Liechtenstein and the Netherlands . However , in 1864 , after the Treaty of Versailles , an agreement was reached between the governments of France and Germany to reduce the number of guns required for the new turret . After the treaty was signed , both countries agreed to pay the cost of replacing the old turret with an improved one .","[""to actual guns and armour .

That conflict also saw the development of the spar torpedo , an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat . For the first time , a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one — and given the relative inefficiency of shellfire against ironclads , the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously .

Early steam engines were inefficient ; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry "" 5 to 9 days coal "" , and the situation was similar with the early ironclads .

","iron clads . By the mid-19th century , however , the iron-clad fleet had become obsolete and was replaced by a new type of steam engine known as a steam-powered catapult . The catapult was the first of its kind in the world , but it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that it became widely used in naval warfare . It was first used by the British navy during the Second World War .","['the early ironclads .

433," Ships designed for coastal warfare , like the floating batteries of the Crimea , or USS Monitor and her sisters , dispensed with masts from the beginning . The British HMS Devastation , started in 1869 , was the first large , ocean @-@ going ironclad to dispense with masts . Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters ; and while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic , she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean . The Devastation and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule . Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts , and only the Italian navy , which during that decade was focused on short @-@ range operations in the Adriatic , built consistently mastless ironclads . 
","support a large fleet , she was not able to do so on her own . In 1871 , the British Admiralty ordered her to be scrapped and replaced by a smaller, more powerful ship , HMS Queen Elizabeth , which she carried with her for the remainder of her life . She was eventually scrapped by the Royal Navy , but the ship remained in service until the end of World War II , when it was commissioned as a replacement for HMS Prince of Wales . During the Korean War , it served as an anti-aircraft gunship , and during the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor in 1941 , as well as in support of Operation Barbarossa and Operation Enduring Freedom .","['cross the Atlantic , she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean .

434," During the 1860s , steam engines improved with the adoption of double @-@ expansion steam engines , which used 30 – 40 % less coal than earlier models . The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double @-@ expansion engine in 1871 , and by 1875 they were widespread . However , this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast . Whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails , or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation , is a matter of debate . A steam @-@ only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide , which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands . Just as significantly , because of unsolved problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines , the performance of double @-@ expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory . 
","to increased demand , it is difficult to say for certain . In 1876 , the British Admiralty announced that it would not allow the use of a single engine for the first time in its fleet . This decision was followed by a series of changes , including the introduction of two new engines in the early 1900s . By the mid-19th century , however , there was no need for a new engine to replace the existing one . As a result , ships were able to use the new steam engine more efficiently than before , but it was still not sufficient to meet the needs of naval vessels .","['to the operational and strategic situation , is a matter of debate .
