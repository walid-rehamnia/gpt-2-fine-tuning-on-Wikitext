15," Du Fu ( Wade – Giles : Tu Fu ; Chinese : 杜甫 ; 712 – 770 ) was a prominent Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty . Along with Li Bai ( Li Po ) , he is frequently called the greatest of the Chinese poets . His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations . His life , like the whole country , was devastated by the An Lushan Rebellion of 755 , and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest . 
",", however , was to become the first poet in the world to write poetry in a Chinese language . He was born in Shanghai in 1868 , and was educated at the University of Hong Kong , where he received a Ph.D. in Chinese literature from the university . In 1874 , Li Fu was appointed to the post of editor of a literary journal .","['was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations .

16," Although initially he was little @-@ known to other writers , his works came to be hugely influential in both Chinese and Japanese literary culture . Of his poetic writing , nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages . He has been called the "" Poet @-@ Historian "" and the "" Poet @-@ Sage "" by Chinese critics , while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as "" the Chinese Virgil , Horace , Ovid , Shakespeare , Milton , Burns , Wordsworth , Béranger , Hugo or Baudelaire "" .

18," Traditional Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work , a practice which Burton Watson attributes to "" the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality "" . Since many of Du Fu 's poems feature morality and history , this practice is particularly important . Another reason , identified by the Chinese historian William Hung , is that Chinese poems are typically concise , omitting context that might be relevant , but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know . For modern Western readers , "" The less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether "" . Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu , arguing that the variety of the poet 's work required consideration of his whole life , rather than the "" reductive "" categorizations used for more limited poets . 
","This is especially true in the case of poems such as the Song of Song , in which the protagonist is told that he is the only one who can save the world from the evil spirits . In this case , however , the reader is left with the impression that the poem is written by a person who is not aware of his or her own existence , and who has no idea of what he or she is doing . The poet is then forced to choose between saving his own life or saving the lives of those around him . As a result , he ends up in a state of despair and despairing , as if he has lost all hope of ever being able to save his life .","['For modern Western readers , "" The less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether "" .

20," Most of what is known of Du Fu 's life comes from his poems . His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan , a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu .

22," The son of a minor scholar @-@ official , his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil servant : study and memorisation of the Confucian classics of philosophy , history and poetry .

23," In the early 730s , he travelled in the Jiangsu / Zhejiang area ; his earliest surviving poem , describing a poetry contest , is thought to date from the end of this period , around 735 . In that year , he took the civil service exam , likely in Chang 'an . He failed , to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics . Hung concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure , while Chou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame . After this failure , he went back to traveling , this time around Shandong and Hebei .

25," In the autumn of 744 , he met Li Bai ( Li Po ) for the first time , and the two poets formed a friendship . David Young describes this as "" the most significant formative element in Du Fu 's artistic development "" because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet @-@ scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam . The relationship was somewhat one @-@ sided , however . Du Fu was by some years the younger , while Li Bai was already a poetic star .

He took the civil service exam a second time during the following year , but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister ( apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals ) . He never again attempted the examinations , instead petitioning the emperor directly in 751 , 754 and probably again in 755 . He married around 752 , and by 757 the couple had had five children — three sons and two daughters — but one of the sons died in infancy in 755 . From 754 he began to have lung problems ( probably asthma ) , the first of a series of ailments which dogged him for the rest of his life .

The emperor was not pleased with the way the family was treated , so he appointed a new governor to replace him , which he did in 902 , 903 and 904 , respectively , after which time he became the first emperor to hold the post of governor for a period of five years .

During this time , Du Fu led a largely itinerant life unsettled by wars , associated famines and imperial displeasure . This period of unhappiness was the making of Du Fu as a poet : Even Shan Chou has written that , "" What he saw around him — the lives of his family , neighbors , and strangers – what he heard , and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns — these became the enduring themes of his poetry "" .

However , in 757 , a rebellion broke out against the imperial government , leading to the death of several hundred thousand people and the destruction of many cities , including the capital of Guizhou .  The uprising was eventually crushed by the People's Liberation Army (PLA ) , which was led by Mao Zedong , who had been exiled to exile in exile from the United States after his death in 1976 .

He was arrested but was pardoned in June . He was granted leave to visit his family in September , but he soon rejoined the court and on December 8 , 757 , he returned to Chang 'an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces . However , his advice continued to be unappreciated , and in the summer of 758 he was demoted to a post as Commissioner of Education in Huazhou .

52," Du Fu 's work is notable above all for its range . Chinese critics traditionally used the term 集大成 ( jídàchéng- "" complete symphony "" ) , a reference to Mencius ' description of Confucius . Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu 's achievement , writing in 813 that his predecessor , "" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly "" . He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he "" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples "" . Furthermore , his poems use a wide range of registers , from the direct and colloquial to the allusive and self @-@ consciously literary . This variety is manifested even within individual works : Owen identifies the , "" rapid stylistic and thematic shifts "" in poems which enable the poet to represent different facets of a situation , while Chou uses the term "" juxtaposition "" as the major analytical tool in her work . Du Fu is noted for having written more on poetics and painting than any other writer of his time . He wrote eighteen poems on painting alone , more than any other Tang poet . Du Fu 's seemingly negative commentary on the prized horse paintings of Han Gan ignited a controversy that has persisted to the present day . 
","abstract . The most famous of his works is a poem by the same name , which he describes as "" the greatest of all Chinese poems "" , and which has been translated into English as the Song of the Three Kingdoms . In addition , he has also written a number of short works , including a collection of poems in the form of a short poem called "" The Great Song "" ( 中文 一般 , 乱馬 ) .  The first of these works was published in 1894 , but it was not until 1892 that he published the second volume of The Song , in which the title was changed to "" A Song for the People of China . ""  He also wrote a few short poems , most of which were written in Chinese , as well as a series of works by other Chinese poets , such as those of Zhuangzi , who is considered to be the most influential Chinese poet of modern times .

53," The tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings ( "" chameleon @-@ like "" according to Watson ) : his earliest works are in a relatively derivative , courtly style , but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion . Owen comments on the "" grim simplicity "" of the Qinzhou poems , which mirrors the desert landscape ; the works from his Chengdu period are "" light , often finely observed "" ; while the poems from the late Kuizhou period have a "" density and power of vision "" . 
","He was a member of a small band of rebels who had been captured by the British during the First World War , and was later killed in action . In the early 1960s , he published a series of short stories in which he described his experiences as a soldier and a rebel .

58," In his lifetime and immediately following his death , Du Fu was not greatly appreciated .

59," However , as Hung notes , he "" is the only Chinese poet whose influence grew with time "" , and his works began to increase in popularity in the ninth century . Early positive comments came from Bai Juyi , who praised the moral sentiments of some of Du Fu 's works ( although he found these in only a small fraction of the poems ) , and from Han Yu , who wrote a piece defending Du Fu and Li Bai on aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them .

60," It was in the 11th century , during the Northern Song era that Du Fu 's reputation reached its peak . In this period a comprehensive re @-@ evaluation of earlier poets took place , in which Wang Wei , Li Bai and Du Fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the Buddhist , Daoist and Confucian strands of Chinese culture . At the same time , the development of Neo @-@ Confucianism ensured that Du Fu , as its poetic exemplar , occupied the paramount position . Su Shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that Du Fu was "" preeminent ... because ... through all his vicissitudes , he never for the space of a meal forgot his sovereign "" . His influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites : political conservatives were attracted by his loyalty to the established order , while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor . Literary conservatives could look to his technical mastery , while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations . Since the establishment of the People 's Republic of China , Du Fu 's loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embryonic nationalism and socialism , and he has been praised for his use of simple , "" people 's language "" .

The Buddha was the first to use the term "" Zen Buddhism "" , which was derived from the Chinese term for the practice of meditation . It was a term that was used to describe the state of mind of an individual who had attained Buddhahood , or enlightenment , at the time of his or her initiation into the world . As a result , it became a popular term in China , where it is still used today to refer to a person who has attained a certain level of enlightenment .","['never for the space of a meal forgot his sovereign "" .

61," Du Fu 's popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of Shakespeare in England : it was hard for any Chinese poet not to be influenced by him . While there was never another Du Fu , individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work : Bai Juyi 's concern for the poor , Lu You 's patriotism , and Mei Yaochen 's reflections on the quotidian are a few examples . More broadly , Du Fu 's work in transforming the lǜshi from mere word play into "" a vehicle for serious poetic utterance "" set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre .

The first notable Japanese appreciator of Du Fu 's poetry was Kokan Shiren ( 1278 – 1346 ) , a Rinzai Zen patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the Five Mountains ; he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on some poems of Du Fu from the perspective of a Zen priest in Vol . 11 of Saihokushū . His student Chūgan Engetsu composed many kanshi which were clearly stated "" influenced by Du Fu "" in their prefaces . Chūgan 's student Gidō Shūshin had close connection with the Court and Ashikaga Shogunate and propagated Du Fu 's poetry in the mundane world ; one day Nijō Yoshimoto , the Kampaku regent of the Court and the highest authority of renga poetry , asked Gidō , "" Should I learn the poetry of Du Fu and Li Bai ? "" Gidō dared to reply , "" Yes if you do have enough capability . No if do not . "" Since then , there had been many seminars on Du Fu 's poetry both in Zen temples and in the aristocratic society , and as a result his poetry was often cited in Japanese literature in the Muromachi period , e.g. , Taiheiki , a historical epic in the late 14th century , and some noh plays such as Hyakuman , Bashō , and Shunkan .

The commentary established Du Fu 's fame as the highest of all poets ; for instance , Hayashi Shunsai , a notable Confucian scholar , commented in Vol . 37 of Gahō Bunshū that Zǐměi [ Du Fu ] was the very best poet in history and praised Shào Chuán 's commentary for its simplicity and readability , while he criticized old commentaries during the Yuan Dynasty were too unfathomable .

The translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding laboured to a Western ear ( particularly when translating regulated verse , or lǜshi ) , and accommodating the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works ( Hawkes writes that "" his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation "" — p. ix ) .

Originally intended to be repeats of the preceding Fusō class , they were redesigned before construction began . Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923 . They were modernized in 1934 – 37 with improvements to their armour and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style . Afterwards they played a minor role in the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War .

111," Despite the expensive reconstructions , both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War , and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war . Following the loss of most of the IJN 's large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid @-@ 1942 , they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of floatplanes . A lack of aircraft and qualified pilots , however , meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat . While awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases . They participated in the Battle of Cape Engaño in late 1944 , where they decoyed the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches . Afterwards both ships were transferred to Southeast Asia ; in early 1945 they participated in Operation Kita , where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan . The sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during American airstrikes in July . After the war they were scrapped in 1946 – 47 . 
","replacement , the U.S. Navy ordered the replacement of two of their main guns , which had been in service since the end of World War II , with the addition of a second gun turret . The remaining guns were replaced by a new turret mounted on the aft side of each ship . In the event of an attack on Pearl Harbor , one of these guns would have been destroyed , but the other would not have survived the attack . As a result , all three ships were sunk , leaving only the two guns to be used against the Japanese . Despite the fact that the battleship was destroyed in one battle , it was not destroyed by fire , nor was it damaged by enemy fire .","['air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases .

113," The design of the Fusō @-@ class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an encounter in Japanese territorial waters .

114," In the aftermath , the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean : Britain and the United States . Satō Tetsutarō , a Japanese Navy admiral and military theorist , speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals . To that end , he called for the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70 % as many capital ships as the US Navy . This ratio , Satō theorized , would enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict . Accordingly , the 1907 Imperial Defence Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships , 20 @,@ 000 long tons ( 20 @,@ 321 t ) each , and eight modern armoured cruisers , 18 @,@ 000 long tons ( 18 @,@ 289 t ) each .

In the event , Japan would be forced to rely more heavily on its navy to defend its territorial integrity , which would result in a loss of naval power and a greater risk of war . The Japanese navy would then be able to concentrate its resources on defending its own territorial waters , while the British and American fleets would concentrate their efforts on protecting their own interests . As a result , Tokyo would lose its naval superiority over the rest of the world , and its ability to control the seas would become less important . Japan's naval strength would also be diminished , as it would no longer have the capacity to effectively defend itself against an attack from any other nation .","['Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict .

116," The first battleships built for the renewed Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program were the two dreadnoughts of the Kawachi class , ordered in 1907 and laid down in 1908 . In 1910 , the Navy put forward a request to the Diet ( parliament ) to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once . Because of economic constraints , only four battlecruisers and a single battleship of the Fusō class were ultimately approved by the Diet . Three more Fusō @-@ class ships ( Yamashiro , Ise , and Hyūga ) were approved and all three were ordered in April 1913 .

118," The progress of Fusō 's construction , while the IJN waited for the funding to be released and foreign developments , caused the IJN to reassess the Fusō @-@ class design . The distribution of the midships gun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the protection of the midships magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired . Another issue was that Japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the 45 @.@ 36 @-@ kilogram ( 100 @.@ 0 lb ) shells used in the manually loaded 152 @-@ millimetre ( 6 in ) secondary guns used in the Fusō class and earlier designs . To resolve this issue , the IJN designed a smaller 140 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire . It also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the British Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships and Russian Borodino @-@ class battlecruisers . For financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by 0 @.@ 5 knots ( 0 @.@ 93 km / h ; 0 @.@ 58 mph ) to 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . To save weight the forecastle deck was shortened so that the lower midships gun turret was lower than in the Fusō class . This reduced the crew 's accommodations despite a significant increase in the crew 's numbers and naval historian Fukui Shizuo believed that these ships had the worst habitability of any Japanese capital ship .

","in armour thickness to compensate for this problem . This led to a design change that reduced the shell thickness by a factor of 10 , resulting in a larger shell diameter and a greater penetration rate . In the end , however , this design did not achieve the desired effect , and the new design was discontinued .  However , it is worth noting that during the construction phase , a number of changes were made , including the addition of a new gun turret , which was designed to reduce the gun diameter by an order of magnitude , as well as the introduction of an improved gun mantlet . These changes resulted in an increase of armour penetration and increased penetration rates , but the overall effect was not as significant as it might have been had the original design not been implemented . As a result of these changes , only a handful of new guns were built , most of which were later introduced into the Japanese fleet , although some of them are still in service today and are used by the U.S. Navy , Marine Corps , Coast Guard , Air Force , Navy and Marine Expeditionary Force .","[""in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the British Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships and Russian Borodino @-@ class battlecruisers .

207," From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North , the North Korean People 's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing . The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively , attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit , which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force , which would then be forced to retreat in disarray , often leaving behind much of its equipment . From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August , the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south . However , when the UN forces , under the Eighth United States Army , established the Pusan Perimeter in August , the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank , and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army . 
","then move on to attack the South Korean capital of Seoul . In the end , however , North Korea was forced to retreat to the south , where it was able to hold its position for a short period of time , before retreating back to its base in the mountains of Chonju , a few hundred kilometers north of Pyongyang .  The United States and its allies continued to use the area as a staging ground for air strikes against the DPRK , but the U.S. and South Koreans were unable to halt the advance until after the Battle of Yalu , in which the two sides had been engaged in a fierce battle for control of a large swath of territory . During the battle , both sides suffered heavy casualties , including the loss of many of their own soldiers and civilians , as well as casualties from artillery fire , mortars , and machine gun fire . On the other hand , Kim Il-sung , who succeeded Kim Jong-il as leader in 1953 , was widely considered to be the most successful leader of his era , having led the country for more than two decades .","['then be forced to retreat in disarray , often leaving behind much of its equipment .

208," When the North Koreans approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5 , they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter . Throughout August , the NK 6th Division , and later the NK 7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan , initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before countering with battles at Komam @-@ ni and Battle Mountain . These attacks stalled as UN forces , well equipped and with plenty of reserves , repeatedly repelled North Korean attacks . North of Masan , the NK 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area . In the First Battle of Naktong Bulge , the North Korean division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it , and on August 19 , the NK 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties . In the Taegu region , five North Korean divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu . Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the Bowling Alley where the NK 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack . On the east coast , three more North Korean divisions were repulsed by the South Koreans at P 'ohang @-@ dong during the Battle of P 'ohang @-@ dong . All along the front , the North Korean troops were reeling from these defeats , the first time in the war their strategies were not working . 
","US and South Korean troops were forced to withdraw from the area to the south . On August 6 , North Korea launched a series of counterattacks on both sides , including a successful counterattack against the American 1st Battalion of the 101st Airborne Division . During the battle , US forces were able to repel an attack by the South Koreans , but the two sides continued to engage each other for several days . By the end of that day , however , both forces had been defeated . The US 9th and 10th Divisions , along with the 2nd and 3rd Battalions , were sent to reinforce the north , while the 3d Battalion , commanded by Lt. Gen. Robert E. Lee , was sent out to defend the east . 
  The battle was a major turning point for the U.S.-North Korean relationship , as the United States and its allies began to work together to counter the threat posed by Pyongyang . After the Korean War ended in 1953 , relations between Washington and Pyongyang were at an all-time low .","[""US reserve forces were brought in to repel it , and on August 19 , the NK 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties .

At the same time , however , the artillery continued to fire toward the north , and the Americans were forced to retreat to the south , where they could continue their assault .  The South Koreans were able to hold their position for a few minutes , but were unable to advance beyond the knoll at which they had begun their advance .

255," During the night Schmitt established radio communication with the 1st Battalion , 9th infantry . When daylight came Schmitt and his group saw that they were surrounded by North Koreans . One force occupied the higher knob half a mile above them , formerly held by B Company . Below them , North Koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units , some of them already several miles eastward . The North Koreans quickly discovered Task Force Manchu group . They first attacked it at 14 : 00 that afternoon , and were repulsed . That night an estimated company attacked three times , pressing the fight to close quarters , but failed each time to penetrate the tight US perimeter .

As they approached the south , they saw a large group of North Korea troops advancing toward them . They were led by Lieutenant General Robert E.

256," In the afternoon of September 2 Schmitt radioed 1st Battalion for an airdrop of supplies . A US plane attempted the drop , but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands . The men in the perimeter did , however , recover from a drop made later at 19 : 00 some supplies and ammunition . Private First Class Joseph R.

257," That same afternoon , the North Koreans sent an American prisoner up the hill to Schmitt with the message , "" You have one hour to surrender or be blown to pieces . "" Failing in frontal infantry attack to reduce the little defending force , the North Koreans now meant to take it under mortar fire . Only 45 minutes later North Korean antitank fire came in on the knob and two machine guns from positions northward and higher on the slope of Hill 209 swept the perimeter . Soon , mortars emplaced on a neighboring high finger ridge eastward registered on Schmitt 's perimeter and continued firing until dark . The machine gun fire forced every man to stay in his foxhole . The lifting of the mortar fire after dark was the signal for renewed North Korean infantry attacks , all of which were repulsed . But the number of killed and wounded within the perimeter was growing , and supplies were diminishing . There were no medical supplies except those carried by one aid man . 
","By the time they reached the top of the ridge , however , they had already taken over the entire hill . The enemy had been forced to retreat to the south , where they would have to wait for reinforcements from the South . North Korea continued to fire at the enemy until it was too late . On the other side , South Korean forces were forced back to their original position by the arrival of U.S. forces . As the two Koreas were fighting for their lives , one of them was killed , while another was wounded , and the remaining two were taken prisoner .

258," The third day , September 3 , the situation worsened . The weather was hot and ammunition , food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted . Since the previous afternoon , North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter . Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed . Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself . Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole . Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units . Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came . Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and threw grenades into it . Six times Ouellette leaped from his foxhole to escape grenades thrown into it . In this close action Ouellette was killed . Most of the foxholes of the perimeter received one or more direct mortar hits in the course of the continuing mortar fire . One of these killed Schmitt on September 3 . The command passed now to First Lieutenant Raymond J. McDoniel of D Company , senior surviving officer . 
","and artillery fire continued to be directed at the North Koreans . On the morning of September 4 , an artillery shell hit a building on the outskirts of the city . It was the first time that artillery shells had been fired in North Korea since the end of World War II . By the time the artillery hit the building , it was too late to save the lives of American soldiers . North Vietnamese troops had already been killed in the attack , and the Americans were forced to withdraw from the area to avoid further casualties . At the same time , South Korean forces were engaged in a fierce battle with the Viet Cong , who were advancing toward the capital of Saigon .","['fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came .

259," At daylight on the morning of 4 September only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill , were alive . As the day passed , with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight , McDoniel decided to abandon the position that night . When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines . That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position . At 22 : 00 , McDoniel and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four . Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins , still alive in his paralyzed condition , refused efforts of evacuation , saying that he did not want to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away . He asked only that his carbine be loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin . Like Oullette , he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions . Of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of September 4 , 22 escaped to friendly lines , many of them following the Naktong downstream , hiding by day and traveling by night , until they reached the lines of the US 25th Infantry Division . 
","McClellan , who was in command of the platoon at the time , was wounded in the leg . He was taken to the hospital where he later died of his wounds .

In the afternoon of 5 September he received a call from his platoon commander telling him that he had been wounded by a mortar shell fired from the direction of a group of North Korean soldiers near the village of Nangarhar . On his way back he heard a loud explosion and saw the bodies of two men lying in a ditch . One of them was a young man , the other a man in his 20s . Both men were shot at close range , and the wounded man was pronounced dead . Two days later , on 6 September , Caldwell received word from a platoon leader that his men had lost their lives and that they were about to be taken prisoner .

346," An ironclad is a steam @-@ propelled warship protected by iron or steel armor plates used in the early part of the second half of the 19th century . The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells . The first ironclad battleship , Gloire , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859 . The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857 ; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron @-@ hulled armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all @-@ armored battle fleet . After the first clashes of ironclads ( both with wooden ships and with one another ) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War , it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat . This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War . 
","design was submitted to the Royal Navy for design consideration . By the end of that year , however , the British Navy had no plans to develop a new type of corvettes , and the idea was shelved until 1864 , when it was decided that the new design would be better suited to naval warfare . In 1866 , a British naval officer proposed a design that would have a steel hull and a reinforced hull , but the proposal was rejected . A second design , which was proposed by a French naval engineer , became the basis for the first British-designed naval cruiser in World War I . It was commissioned in May 1867 , with the intention of replacing the original design with a more modern design .","['Royal Navy started building two iron @-@ hulled armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all @-@ armored battle fleet .

347," Ironclads were designed for several roles , including as high seas battleships , coastal defense ships , and long @-@ range cruisers .

348," The quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished , and that naval tactics were in a state of flux . Many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo , which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat . There is no clear end to the ironclad period , but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use . New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers .

352," In the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship , the ship of the line and the frigate . The first major change to these types was the introduction of steam power for propulsion .

By 1844 , however , the fleet had been reduced to a few hundred and fifty ships .

359," Following the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the Battle of Sinop , and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the Paixhans guns of Russian fortifications in the Crimean War , Emperor Napoleon III ordered the development of light @-@ draft floating batteries , equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor .

","World War II showed that these batteries could be used to destroy a large number of enemy ships in a short period of time .

","however , they were not as fast as the British ships , and were therefore more vulnerable to attack from enemy ships . In the event of a naval clash , the Royal Fleet would be forced to rely on a combination of speed and endurance to keep up with the speed of enemy vessels .

These ships were also used in the Battle of Stirling , where the battle was fought between the English and French fleets .  The battleship HMS Dreadnought was used as an example of this type of battle , in which both sides would use their ships to destroy each other in an attempt to force the other to retreat , while the HMS Prinz Eugenie , a British flagship , was also heavily damaged by an enemy attack , resulting in a loss of life and the destruction of her entire class of warships","[""their weapons were more effective than that of Gloire , and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam at 14 @.@ 3 knots ( 26 @.@ 5 km / h ) .

If the breech — which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun — is not entirely secure , then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break .

396," From 1875 onwards , the balance between breech- and muzzle @-@ loading changed . Captain de Bange invented a method of reliably sealing a breech , adopted by the French in 1873 .

With guns of such size there was no prospect of hauling in the gun for re @-@ loading , or even re @-@ loading by hand , and complicated hydraulic systems were required for re @-@ loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire .

398," The calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far . The larger the gun , the slower it would be to load , the greater the stresses on the ship 's hull , and the less the stability of the ship .

One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models , following the Crimean War , range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy , especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as ' floating weapons @-@ platform ' could negate the advantage of rifling . American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least ' skip ' along the surface of the water .

399," Another method of increasing firepower was to vary the projectile fired or the nature of the propellant . Early ironclads used black powder , which expanded rapidly after combustion ; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels , to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell . The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress . One important step was to press the powder into pellets , allowing a slower , more controlled explosion and a longer barrel . A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again . It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel , allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances . 
","example of this was the firing of a .50 calibre machine gun at a range of 1,000 yards ( 2,500 nautical miles ) from the target . Another example is the use of incendiary shells at ranges of 3,600 to 4,800 feet ( 6 to 8 m ) . In addition , the projectiles were fired at high velocities , so that they could be fired from a distance of less than 1 mile ( 1.5 km ) away .","['important step was to press the powder into pellets , allowing a slower , more controlled explosion and a longer barrel .

400," The development of smokeless powder , based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose , by the French inventor Paul Vielle in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels . The guns of the pre @-@ Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s , most often 12 in ( 305 mm ) , but progressively grew in length of barrel , making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity . 
","17th and 18th centuries were made from nitrous oxide , which had been used in the early 19th century as an oxidizer . Nitrogen oxide was also used as a fuel during the Battle of Britain , but it was not widely used during World War I .","['1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s , most often 12 in ( 305 mm ) , but progressively grew in length of barrel , making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity .']"

405," A significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the 1860s , principally in Britain and France , but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy , Austria , Russia and the United States .

408," There were two main design alternatives to the broadside . In one design , the guns were placed in an armoured casemate amidships : this arrangement was called the ' box @-@ battery ' or ' centre @-@ battery ' . In the other , the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire ; when fully armored , this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored , a barbette . 
","The casemates were mounted at the rear of the gun , which was mounted on the turret . A second design was used for the main gun .

409," The centre @-@ battery was the simpler and , during the 1860s and 1870s , the more popular method . Concentrating guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter and handier than a broadside type . The first full @-@ scale centre @-@ battery ship was HMS Bellerophon of 1865 ; the French laid down centre @-@ battery ironclads in 1865 which were not completed until 1870 .

410," The turret was first used in naval combat on the USS Monitor in 1862 , with a type of turret designed by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson . A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor Cowper Coles with a prototype of this installed on HMS Trusty in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes . Ericsson 's turret turned on a central spindle , and Coles 's turned on a ring of bearings . Turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns , but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s . The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging , so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean @-@ going ironclads . The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy . Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret ( guns and armour protection ) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard . The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour . Low freeboard , however , also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage — and therefore range of the vessel . In many respects , the turreted , low @-@ freeboard Monitor and the broadside sailer HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an ' Ironclad ' was all about . The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes , or ' squaring this circle ' , was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles : HMS Captain , a dangerously low freeboard turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail , and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870 . Her half @-@ sister HMS Monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams .

","to the lower deck , where it could be used as an anchor for the ship . This allowed the hull to be lowered to a lower level , allowing the turret to remain in place for extended periods of time . By the end of the Civil War , the turrets had been replaced by a new design , which allowed them to operate at a much higher rate of power than the old designs . In the early years of World War I , however, the new turret designs were more difficult to maintain , as they required the use of more powerful engines and less powerful propellers . As a result , a number of battles were fought between the two designs , including the Battle of Stalingrad in 1864 and the Siege of Normandy in June of that year . During the war , both designs had their fair share of casualties , though the latter was the most heavily damaged .  The first battle was fought on July 7 , 1866 , when the first of two turrets was destroyed by enemy fire , while the second battle took place on August 1 , 1767 , during which the third and fourth turret were destroyed , leaving only the fourth and fifth turrets in their place . On the other hand , it was during this period that the fifth and sixth turrets first appeared on board the battleship HMS Queen Elizabeth , after which it became known as the ' Queen ' turret , due to its resemblance to that of its predecessor . It was also the only turret in service with the Royal Navy during the War of 1812 and 1813 , having been commissioned as part of HMS Royal Marines in July 1814 , at the request of Lord Cornwallis , who was then Lord Commander of British forces in Ireland .","[""to actual guns and armour .

433," Ships designed for coastal warfare , like the floating batteries of the Crimea , or USS Monitor and her sisters , dispensed with masts from the beginning . The British HMS Devastation , started in 1869 , was the first large , ocean @-@ going ironclad to dispense with masts . Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters ; and while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic , she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean . The Devastation and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule . Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts , and only the Italian navy , which during that decade was focused on short @-@ range operations in the Adriatic , built consistently mastless ironclads . 
","be used as a carrier , she was also capable of carrying a large number of ships , including the HMS Prince of Wales , which she had been commissioned to defend against a British attack . In 1872 , the British Admiralty ordered the ship to return to Portsmouth , where it was to remain until the end of World War I . She was later commissioned by the United States Navy , but was not commissioned until 1873 , when it became operational . During the war , it served as an escort ship for the U.S. Pacific Fleet , and during the Battle of Pearl Harbor , as well as in Operation Enduring Freedom .","['cross the Atlantic , she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean .

434," During the 1860s , steam engines improved with the adoption of double @-@ expansion steam engines , which used 30 – 40 % less coal than earlier models . The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double @-@ expansion engine in 1871 , and by 1875 they were widespread . However , this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast . Whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails , or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation , is a matter of debate . A steam @-@ only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide , which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands . Just as significantly , because of unsolved problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines , the performance of double @-@ expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory . 
","to increased demand , it is difficult to say for certain . It is also possible that the introduction of a new type of steam engine led to an increase in the amount of coal required to power the ship . In 1876 , the British government announced that it would reduce its reliance on coal by 50 % . This was followed by a series of major changes in ship design , including the addition of new sails and the removal of sails from the hull . By the mid-19th century , however , coal was still a major source of fuel for ships .","['to the operational and strategic situation , is a matter of debate .
